    S --> Single responsibility principle
A class should only have a single responsibility, that is, only changes to one part of the
software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class.

    o --> Openâ€“closed principle
"Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."

    l --> Liskov substitution principle
"Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering
the correctness of that program." See also design by contract.

    i -->Interface segregation principle
"Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface."

    d -->Dependency inversion principle
One should "depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions."
